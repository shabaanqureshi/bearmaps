# Bear Maps

This is a web application similar to Google Maps except it covers only a small area of the city of Berkeley.

The applicaiton supports supports zooming, scrolling and route finding. It uses Quadtree data structure for map restering and A* algorithm to calculate the shortest paths between two coordinates on the map.

NOTE: I apologize heavily for some variable naming which makes the code unreadable at times. I did this class project when I was relatively new to CS.
